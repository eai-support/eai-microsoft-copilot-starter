# EAI Repo Contract

Use this file when a repository is already initialized from the EAI app
template, or when Gofer is about to initialize one.

## Purpose

This is the repo-owned fallback contract for any AI agent working in an
EAI-oriented repository. It defines the minimum safe behavior even when live
docs are unavailable.

Treat this file and the adjacent fallback references as repo-owned guidance in
the same trust boundary as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and other checked-in
instruction files. They are not a cryptographic proof of external platform
state.

## Detecting An EAI Repo

Treat the repo as EAI-initialized when either of these marker sets exists:

- both `src/eai.config/object-types.ts` and `src/eai.config/register.ts`
- `manifest.yml` together with the `src/eai.config/` directory

The broader EAI app shape often also includes `.env.example`, `.npmrc`, and a
template-owned `package.json`, but those are supporting signals rather than the
primary identification markers.

## Mandatory First Actions

Before app-delivery research, planning, implementation, or validation:

1. Read `.specify/specs/{feature}/eai-preflight.md` when it exists.
2. Read `.specify/references/platform/eai-error-catalog.yaml`.
3. Read `.specify/references/platform/eai-service-patterns.md` before choosing
   storage, workflow, content, search, AI, or integration services.
4. If CLI, login, tenant, template, or Gofer readiness is missing or stale, run
   `/gofer:eai-first-run`.
5. Use current CLI discovery instead of memory:
   - `eai update --check`
   - `eai --describe`
   - `eai agent guide --format json` when advertised
   - `eai whoami`
   - `eai tenant list --format json`
   - `eai provision entra` when advertised and identity setup is in scope
6. Do not invent, guess, or complete EAI CLI commands from memory. Before
   suggesting or running an `eai ...` command, verify the exact command and
   flags from `eai --describe` and command-specific `--help`. If the installed
   CLI does not list it, do not run it.
7. When the repo is an EAI project, check drift before further build work:
   - `eai template check --format json`
   - `eai gofer refresh --check --format json`
   - `eai workflow readiness --format json` when advertised by the CLI

## Tenant Data Access Rule

Tenant apps access EAI data as the signed-in user. Browser code calls the local
BFF at `/api/eai/...`; the BFF forwards to PublicAPI with the user's session
token. Do not add app-only `client_credentials` helpers, `EAI_SERVICE_*`, or
`OBO_*` credentials for normal ResourceAPI reads, writes, files, or search. If
work must continue after the user leaves the page, create/request a platform
workflow/job from the signed-in user flow and pass tenant, app, user, and
purpose context into it.

## Stack Policy

For application delivery:

1. EAI Platform first, including the EAI app template.
2. Azure second, where it fits the documented EAI operating model.
3. Everything else only by explicit exception recorded in the feature artifacts.

Do not silently replace an unavailable EAI capability with a non-EAI primary
runtime, database, or hosting stack.

## Platform Service Choice Rule

For normal app work, make the best EAI Platform service choice for the business
user and record it in `service-fit-matrix.md`.

- Use PostgreSQL for relational, transactional, reporting, workflow state,
  audit, and structured tenant business data.
- Use DocumentDB for flexible JSON documents, nested records, high-change
  schemas, and user-authored document state.
- Use Blob Storage for large files, binary content, exports, and file-like
  resources behind API-mediated access.
- Use AI Search as a derived full-text, vector, or hybrid search projection, not
  as the source of record.
- Use EAI content understanding and document services for classification,
  extraction, summarization, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
- Use EAI workflows, goals, and targets for approvals, long-running work,
  service goals, operating targets, and auditable process state.
- Use platform AI services and workflow-backed agents before direct provider
  SDKs or provider keys.

Ask the user only when the choice affects cost, security, compliance,
deployment, data residency, external systems, or material business scope.

## Ordered App-Delivery Gates

Unless the live CLI advertises a different authoritative dependency, preserve
this gate order:

1. Template init or verify current template ownership
2. Dependency install
3. Login and tenant selection
4. App list/create/select
5. `eai app provision`
6. `eai provision entra` when required
7. `eai env pull` when required
8. `eai types validate --tenant-key <key> --tenant-id <tenant-id>`
9. `eai types seed`
10. `eai types diff`
11. `eai resources schema`
12. Storage diagnostics and verification
13. Workflow readiness and resource-call verification
14. Preview or dev startup

Treat these as separate gates:

- provisioning
- object-type publish
- schema/storage health
- workflow readiness
- preview readiness

## Error Recovery Rule

When an EAI CLI or platform command fails:

1. Match the failure against
   `.specify/references/platform/eai-error-catalog.yaml`.
2. Run `eai errors explain <code-or-reason> --format json` when the CLI
   advertises it, and use its public-safe reasons plus next `eai` commands
   before guessing platform internals.
3. Run read-only diagnostics from the guidance before mutating fixes. Apply a
   mutating fix only when it is listed by live EAI guidance or the fallback
   catalog and the user has approved any admin or tenant-membership change.
4. Record the command shape, status, server code, request ID when present, last
   completed gate, blocked gate, and next recovery command in
   `.specify/specs/{feature}/eai-preflight.md`.
5. Stop at the retry or escalation condition instead of repeatedly rerunning the
   same failing command.
6. Do not invent a new order or mark the repo ready when a prior gate is still
   blocked.

For tenant member or admin changes, prefer `eai user invite`, `eai user list`,
`eai user roles`, and `eai user role set` over direct database edits or cloud
portal changes. If `eai user invite` fails with `EXTERNAL_SERVICE_ERROR`, a 5xx
status, or the `user_invite_external_service_existing_member` reason, check for
an existing direct member with
`eai user list --tenant <tenant-id> --search <email> --format json`. If a direct
member exists and the user approves, update the role with
`eai user role set --tenant <tenant-id> --member-id <member-id> --role tenant-admin --format json`,
verify the read-back, and tell the affected app user to sign out and sign back
in because Auth.js session or JWT role data may be cached.

For Entra browser sign-in failures, treat `AADSTS50011`, redirect URI mismatch
messages, and `/api/auth/callback/microsoft-entra-id` callback errors as EAI
identity provisioning problems first. Confirm login and tenant with `eai whoami`
and `eai tenant list --format json`, select the correct tenant if needed, then
run the advertised equivalent of
`eai provision entra --force --redirect-uri <confirmed-callback-uri>`. Record
only a redacted callback route in Gofer artifacts. Use `--debug` only with
explicit user approval, and redact private hostnames, tenant IDs, client IDs,
tokens, and raw debug output before writing artifacts. Use Azure Portal edits
only when the installed EAI CLI does not advertise an Entra provisioning path or
the CLI reports an operator-only block.

## Privacy And Safety

- Do not record tokens, secrets, or `.env.local` values in Gofer artifacts.
- Record tenant and app state in product-safe labels only.
- Keep repo-owned fallback references public-safe and non-sensitive.
