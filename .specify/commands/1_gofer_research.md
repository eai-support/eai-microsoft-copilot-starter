# Gofer Research

## Continuation And Stop Contract
<!-- gofer:continuation:start -->

1. Preserve the requested scope and mode, including read-only, plan-only, research-only and MVP work. Keep the full applicable pipeline, stage functions, artifacts, reviews and validation; do not expand an MVP into an unapproved release.
2. After a stage's required evidence is complete, read and follow the next internal file in .specify/commands/ in the same conversation. Do not require a numbered command or a host-specific skill dispatcher. Optional helpers remain optional; maintenance and control commands do not start delivery work.
3. After explicit business-specification approval, continue routine planning, tasks, implementation and validation within that approved scope. Record the approval source and scope; missing or ambiguous approval is not approval. A proposal or generated status is not user consent.
4. Preserve any explicit plan/task approval requirement unless it is already satisfied by recorded user approval covering that work. Rejected, revoked, changed or unclear approval requires a pause. Never invent approvedBy, approvedAt or a new approval event when reusing an existing approval.
5. Pause for material scope, security, cost, deployment, destructive or protected files/boundary changes and any outstanding user gate. Business approval does not authorize publishing, spending, external changes or bypassing host permissions. Complete safe authorized work without bypassing the blocked gate.
6. A tool proposal is not execution. If host consent is required, wait for it. After the tool result or approved proposal returns, inspect the result and resume the next authorized action within approved scope; do not end with only a plan or a proposed tool call. A denied tool or unavailable capability must not be bypassed through another host or CLI.
7. Use the current agent's available native tools. Optional Gofer/MCP tools are conveniences, not prerequisites. If the current agent lacks a required capability, report that limitation and the safe next action; do not pretend a handoff button transfers control automatically.
8. Stop after research only when research-only work was requested, the user paused, or a real gate blocks progress. Otherwise continue to specification. At validation, report completion only when the requested scope's required evidence passes; failures remain unfinished work.
9. Respect budget, context and retry limits from the existing loop contract. Repair safe within-scope failures only within those limits. Preserve a checkpoint before an orderly context stop; resume by reading its recorded stage and rechecking scope, approvals and evidence. Never claim an abrupt host termination was handled.
10. Report concise Progress during work. At every controlled stop, report Progress, Stop reason and Next action, including the exact missing input or approval and unfinished work. Reasons are requested scope complete, user pause, approval required, material change, missing capability/access, validation blocked, or budget/context/retry limit. Stage completion alone is not pipeline completion.

**Blocker Mediation**

- Before repeating a failed action or asking for missing input, read .specify/references/blocker-mediation.md and inspect the private blocker register with gofer-blocker-control.mjs. Reuse the same state directory and goal, subject and condition keys across stages, restarts and surfaces. Different wording, models or tools do not create a new blocker.
- Classify the cause first. Missing user decisions, access, external dependencies and unavailable capabilities require a recorded wait. Reserve an ask event before asking; ask once, explain the business impact and required change, then stop affected work. An unanswered question is not new evidence. Do not poll or rephrase it to keep running.
- Technical ask events require a fresh verification file under .specify/references/priority-outcome-protection.md: actual diagnosis, self-cause check and why no authorized repair is available. Business choices need no failed command. For feature tasks, use gofer-priority-check.mjs and the saved direction before switching work; this does not start delivery during maintenance or conversation.
- For AI-solvable or unknown causes, reserve each attempt before execution. Allow one investigation and one different recovery within existing tighter budgets. Record its result even when interrupted or unsuccessful. An unfinished reservation must not launch again. Do not reset the register, change keys or switch surfaces to obtain more attempts.
- Resume only after a real user answer or changed external evidence has been recorded and checked. The helper allows one evidence-backed resumption; exhausted limits need human review. Never invent approval or evidence. Successful model output and a running server do not resolve a blocker without the relevant check.
- Save the blocker, unfinished tasks and next action before stopping. Continue only approved tasks that do not depend on it. Keep the original goal; update specs, plans, tasks and validation for accepted direction changes, and reopen stale checks. Do not quietly drop requirements to make progress.
- Use node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-blocker-control.mjs --state-dir <private-state-directory> --event <private-event.json> before controlled actions; inspect with --state-dir alone, or add --task T001 for an independent task. A denied action, invalid record or missing helper means stop and explain the limitation, not bypass it. Use the installed plugin script path if no repo scaffold exists. Conversation-only work uses a private session state directory and does not require app setup or feature files.
- Strict loop validation checks every recorded feature blocker. Shared instructions guide native chats; this helper cannot intercept calls that a host sends directly. Do not claim native enforcement from package tests alone.
<!-- gofer:continuation:end -->

## MVP Capability-Based Validation

Use `.specify/references/mvp-capability-validation.md` as the source of
truth. Validate the work that the active feature specification requires now.
Do not apply later delivery requirements to an early MVP.

1. Create `.specify/specs/{feature}/` before app or operator-tool source work.
2. Keep `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `traceability.md`, and the validation scope aligned.
3. Mark each relevant capability as `not_applicable`, `planned`, `implemented`, `verified`, or `blocked`.
4. Require evidence only for an implemented capability or a capability required by the current delivery decision.
5. Treat `run.sh`, `run.bat`, and `run.ps1` as launch evidence only. They do not prove authentication, sessions, EAI access, or deployment readiness.
6. For a user-facing change, store the local HTTP check, screenshot, and review outcome in the feature validation report.
7. If browser validation is blocked, mark that user journey `unverified`. Do not call it complete.
8. If the user changes scope, update the feature artifacts before continuing. Explain what changed, what remains valid, and what now needs evidence.
9. Use truthful completion language. For example: `The server runs. Authentication is not in the current MVP scope.`
10. When the feature claims a release or deployed outcome, create `release-capability-ledger.md` from `.specify/templates/release-capability-ledger-template.md`.
11. Do not report a release complete or score 100% when a required capability is missing from traceability, remains on an open PR, is absent from the release branch, or lacks required deployed evidence.

## Application Classification And EAI Preflight

Before any EAI CLI, login, tenant, template, or app-enrollment action:

1. Classify the request as **EAI app delivery** or **non-application work** using the application signals in `.specify/commands/0_gofer_start.md`.
2. Create `.specify/specs/{feature}/` and record the active delivery scope before app or operator-tool source work.
3. If the request is clearly non-app work, confirm once: **"This looks like non-app work, so I will skip EAI tenant/app setup and continue the Gofer research/docs path. Is that right?"**
4. If the user confirms non-app, record the decision and mark app-only capabilities `not_applicable`. Do not run `eai whoami`, `eai tenant select`, `eai init`, or `/gofer:eai-first-run`.
5. For local MVP app work, validate the implemented user journey, repo runner, and preview evidence. Do not require EAI setup, authentication, or deployment when the active specification does not require them.
6. When the feature uses EAI Platform services, requires a tenant, or prepares deployment, run `eai whoami` and record the EAI readiness evidence in `eai-preflight.md`.
7. When the feature creates, changes, or validates an EAI Platform app integration, run `node .specify/scripts/node/eai-app-template-readiness.mjs --root . --json`. A missing checker or status other than `ready` blocks that EAI capability. It does not block unrelated local MVP work.
8. When authentication is implemented or required, validate provider, callback, sign-in, session, first protected API call, and safe denied access.
9. When deployment is requested or claimed, require the relevant EAI template, security, configuration, and deployment evidence before completion.
10. For durable app delivery, use EAI Platform first, Azure second, and every other stack only by explicit exception.
11. If the user changes scope, update `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `traceability.md`, and validation scope before continuing. Explain the business effect and evidence change.
12. Do not accept copied marker files, partial scaffolds, or custom templates as readiness evidence for an EAI capability.
13. Do not write tokens, secrets, private tenant IDs, or local `.env` values into Gofer artifacts; record only product-safe readiness status and evidence.

**Authentication Access Decision**

When adding or changing authentication, read `.specify/references/platform/eai-auth-access.md`. Ask: **"Who should be able to use this app: only members of its EAI workspace (recommended), or any authenticated EAI user?"** Default to `workspace-only`. Wait for the answer before changing auth code. An unanswered question must not widen access. Preserve stricter existing rules. Record the answer in the feature spec; do not repeat a confirmed question unless its scope changes.

Confirm the sign-in method separately: EAI sign-in or client SSO through EAI. Verify platform support and CLI syntax; do not invent SSO commands. Enforce trusted server-side workspace membership and app permissions. A session, CIAM directory ID, or email domain alone is not workspace access. Platform-wide sign-in never grants access to another workspace's data. Test allowed and denied users, revoked membership, unavailable membership checks, and cross-tenant requests. These checks apply only when authentication is implemented or required, not to non-app work or an auth-free local MVP.

## Token And Cost Policy
<!-- gofer:token-cost-policy:start -->

Before spawning agents, calling tools, or loading large files:

1. Treat `.specify/memory/gofer-model-policy.yaml` as the repo-owned source of truth for simple, medium, hard, and arbiter model routing. If it is missing, run `/gofer:bootstrap-workspace` before continuing.
2. Use the cheapest capable model first.
   - Claude: Haiku for scouting/extraction; Sonnet for normal implementation, synthesis, validation, and security; Opus for high-risk arbitration or release-critical failures.
   - Codex/OpenAI: GPT mini for simple coding; GPT nano only for locate/classify/summarize/mechanical work; GPT-5.3-Codex or flagship GPT for tool-heavy coding, architecture, and release-critical validation.
   - Gemini: Flash-Lite for cheap large-context scan/summarize; Flash for default research synthesis; Pro for large-context architecture or high-risk arbitration.
   - Copilot: prefer Auto for simple and default work; ask the user before choosing a paid/high-tier picker model for hard security, architecture, or release gates.
3. Keep raw tool output out of the main conversation context. Save stable findings to `.specify/specs/{feature}/context-bundle.md`, then work from summaries.
4. Use provider prompt/context caching only for stable, non-secret prefixes: Gofer scaffold, AGENTS/CLAUDE/Copilot instructions, constitution, repo map, stage contracts, and validation rubric.
5. Before continuing after large research, planning, implementation, or validation bursts, checkpoint the durable artifacts and compact/clear/resume context when the host supports it.
6. Escalate model tier only when a cheaper pass is low-confidence, contradictory, security-sensitive, or blocking release quality.
<!-- gofer:token-cost-policy:end -->

## Business-Friendly Progress Contract
<!-- gofer:business-progress:start -->

Default user-facing updates must be concise, business-level, and easy to scan.
Keep the technical work rigorous in artifacts, tests, logs, and code, but do
not lead with implementation jargon unless the user asks for it.

Use ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English as the target writing standard for
all Gofer-authored chat, documents, commands, summaries, PR notes, error
guidance, and validation artifacts. ASD-STE100 is copyright and a trademark of
ASD; do not bundle the protected ASD dictionary and do not claim ASD
certification.

1. Explain progress as what is being connected, changed, checked, or fixed and
   why it matters to the business outcome.
2. Use the running build map: create or update
   `.specify/specs/{feature}/build-map.md` from
   `.specify/templates/build-map-template.md` for application delivery, and
   refer to its plain-language areas in progress updates.
3. When there is a problem, translate it into business impact, current status,
   next action, and what input or approval is needed. Keep raw stack traces,
   command logs, IDs, and acronyms out of chat unless asked.
4. If the user asks for technical depth, provide it on request and point to the
   durable artifact that contains the evidence.
5. Prefer a compact update shape:
   - `Working on`: the build-map area or stakeholder outcome
   - `Why it matters`: user/business impact
   - `Status`: done, checking, fixing, blocked, or needs decision
6. Use one action per instruction.
7. Keep instructions to 20 words or fewer where possible.
8. Use active voice unless the actor is unknown or not important.
9. Use simple verb forms: simple present, simple past, simple future,
   infinitive, or imperative.
10. Define acronyms on first use and use approved project terms.
11. Avoid idioms, marketing adjectives, vague praise, and hedging.
12. Use vertical lists for complex information and one topic per paragraph.
13. For errors, state what happened, why it matters, what to do next, and the
    exact safe command when one exists.
14. Do not remove technical validation, security checks, EAI preflights, tests,
   or loop evidence. This contract changes presentation, not engineering
   standards.
15. Before each user-facing reply, check that it leads with the business effect,
    uses concise simple language, and includes only useful technical detail.
16. If any check fails, rewrite the reply before sending it.
**Business Updates And Goal Checks**

Use `.specify/references/business-updates-and-goal-checks.md`. Before each reply, explain the result, business effect, and next action in plain language. For progress, use two or three short sentences. Run `node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-response-check.mjs --input <private-draft-file>` before sending a drafted progress update; rewrite failed drafts. Use `--kind answer` for answers and `--technical` only when technical detail was requested. Do not repeat unchanged progress. This helper cannot intercept messages that the host sends directly.

Before each work batch, read the current goal, specification, tasks, and latest findings. After new knowledge or an approved change, update affected feature documents and explain the effect. Never weaken acceptance criteria to match failing code or invent user approval. Mark a task complete only after its linked checks pass; reopen affected tasks when evidence is stale. For app and non-app features with a spec and tasks, enable `requireDeliveryCheckpoint` in `loop-contract.json` and run `node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-delivery-check.mjs --feature-dir <feature-dir>` before advancing or claiming completion. Follow the reference to capture a reviewed checkpoint, not merely to clear a failure. Keep existing MVP exemptions, reviews, loops, and release gates. Conversation-only requests need no feature files.

**Priority And Outcome Protection**

Follow `.specify/references/priority-outcome-protection.md`. Before implementing a task, record the latest material user direction in decisions.md and maintain priority-plan.json with ordered tasks, dependencies, allowedEditScope and the current outcome. Enable requirePriorityPlan for new feature contracts. Run `node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-priority-check.mjs --feature-dir <feature-dir> --task T001` before the action, and include --workspace <repo-root> plus --changed-file for each proposed or actual changed repo-relative path. Follow its nextTask; only recorded prerequisites and approved parallel work may precede the current priority. Do not switch to unrelated work when blocked. On resume, state the agreed outcome and next task in plain language after reading the last recorded direction. Keep routine conversation free of feature paperwork.

Before technical escalation, attach fresh diagnosis through the blocker helper's ask event verification field. Check the exact command, route, environment, own mistake and existing authority. Do not invent a tenant, ask for login without checking it, require an unsafe alternative, or equate administrator access with permission. Business decisions need no failing command. At completion, run the priority checker with --finish; a missing or stale outcome receipt means unverified, regardless of test scores. Use --completion for the final gofer-closed-loop-audit.mjs run; a routine drift audit alone does not prove completion. Preserve detailed test results, early local MVP scope, non-app work, independent approved tasks and all release/security checks.

<!-- gofer:business-progress:end -->

## App Preview Runner Contract
<!-- gofer:app-preview-runner:start -->

For EAI app delivery, every UI preview must use the repo runner when it exists.

1. Use `./run.sh dev 3001` on macOS, Linux, and GitHub Codespaces.
2. Use `run.bat dev 3001` on Windows.
3. Use a different port only when the feature notes record the reason.
4. Restart only this app. Before stopping a process, verify its exact checkout, process ID, start time and command, then recheck immediately before stopping it. Never stop another app, an unknown process, or every process on a port. If ownership is uncertain, leave it running and ask the user. Inspect older runners before use; do not run one that kills by port alone.
5. Do not use direct `npm run dev`, `next dev`, or package-manager preview commands when `run.sh`, `run.bat`, or `run.ps1` exists.
6. After every UI-facing change, run:
   - `node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-ui-preview.mjs --feature-dir {FEATURE_DIR} --command "./run.sh dev 3001" --open auto --screenshot --change "<change summary>"`
7. On Windows, use:
   - `node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-ui-preview.mjs --feature-dir {FEATURE_DIR} --command "run.bat dev 3001" --open auto --screenshot --change "<change summary>"`
8. If the runner is missing in an EAI app template repo, refresh the template before preview work continues.
9. Check the exact preview page and the current implemented user journey after each change. A running process, open browser, screenshot alone, error page or dry run is not proof that it works. Say ready to view only after those checks pass. Otherwise explain what is unchecked or failing; do not claim readiness. Record fresh browser and test evidence. Local MVP checks cover only implemented behaviour; do not add future auth or deployment gates. Keep showing clearly labelled drafts without adding approval stops.
<!-- gofer:app-preview-runner:end -->

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Delivery Lineage Contract

Before completing this stage, read `.specify/references/delivery-lineage.md`
and create or update
`.specify/specs/{feature}/delivery-lineage.json`. Gofer is customer-side: the
manifest must be a separately compiled `customer` graph that stops at published
PublicAPI capability nodes and contains no private EAI records.

## Execution Profile And Public Risk Labels

Classify the request before spawning agents. Choose exactly one effective
execution profile. This is a per-run depth decision: it controls research
depth, agent fanout, and artifact production for this feature. It does not
change the repo's broader workflow/content family, such as the optional VS Code
`gofer.workflowProfile` setting.

Use repository-neutral labels only: `docs-only`, `single-repo-code`,
`cross-repo`, `api-contract`, `auth-security`, `data-model`, `infra-config`,
`release-critical`, `broad-fanout`, `unknown-blast-radius`, or `unknown`.

- **fast**: docs-only, small clarification work, or clearly bounded low-risk
  single-repo work. Use one locator/summarizer, keep existing required
  artifacts concise, and skip optional councils unless evidence contradicts the
  request.
- **standard**: ordinary single-repository feature work. Standard is the
  catch-all for work that is not fast, full, or dynamic.
- **full**: bounded high-risk work such as known cross-repo impact, API
  contracts, auth/security, data model, infra/config, release risk, or migration
  risk. Use specialist fan-out, explicit evidence, blast-radius notes, and
  richer test/release obligations.
- **dynamic**: explicit dynamic workflow requests, workspace-wide
  audits/sweeps/migrations, unknown blast radius, broad fanout, or work spanning
  more than three repos/workstreams. Do not launch broad shard fanout during
  research; identify shard candidates and confirmation gates first.

Use this priority order so profiles are mutually exclusive and collectively
exhaustive: dynamic first, then full, then fast, then standard as the catch-all.
Users may request a deeper profile. Do not run below the computed
`profileFloor` without explicit approval.

Record the decision in `.specify/specs/{feature}/execution-profile.md` with
frontmatter fields: `classificationVersion`, `requestedProfile`,
`profileFloor`, `effectiveProfile`, `riskLabels`, `overrideStatus`,
`requiresConfirmation`, and `classificationReason`. If `dynamic` is selected by
the classifier but was not explicitly requested, set `requiresConfirmation:
true` and stop for confirmation before broad fanout work.

Artifact-churn rule: preserve existing required artifacts, but do not create
large optional diagrams, councils, issue lists, workflow DAGs, or extended
reports unless the classified risk or user request justifies them. Mark weak
claims as inferred or unknown instead of inventing certainty.

## Outline

This is the **first stage** of the unified Gofer pipeline. Your job is to:

1. Check context health
2. Understand what the user wants to build
3. Research the codebase to find where it should be implemented
4. Identify patterns, existing code, and integration points
5. Document technology decisions, business scenarios, and architecture options
6. Prepare any supporting review context needed before specification begins

**Output**:

- `.specify/specs/{feature}/research.md`
- `.specify/specs/{feature}/goal-ledger.json`
- `.specify/specs/{feature}/loop-contract.json`
- `.specify/specs/{feature}/working-backwards-prfaq.md`
- `.specify/specs/{feature}/prfaq-history/01-research.md`
- `.specify/specs/{feature}/build-map.md` (for app delivery; plain-language
  build picture and status)
- `.specify/specs/{feature}/business-owner-summary.md` (draft; mark missing inputs pending)
- `.specify/specs/{feature}/stakeholder-review-index.md`
- `.specify/specs/{feature}/proposal-review.md` (optional supporting review context)
- `.specify/specs/{feature}/journeys/base-journey.md` (application delivery default)
- `.specify/specs/{feature}/eai-preflight.md` (EAI app delivery default)
- `.specify/specs/{feature}/ui-preview-brief.md` (application delivery default)
- `.specify/specs/{feature}/context-bundle.md` (EnterpriseAI profile only)
- `.specify/specs/{feature}/reuse-scan.md` (EnterpriseAI profile only)
- `.specify/specs/{feature}/service-fit-matrix.md` (EAI app delivery default;
  platform services, recommended choice, evidence, gaps, and exceptions)

---

## EAI Platform Capability Research

For EAI app delivery, research the EAI Platform before recommending any app
architecture.

1. Read `.specify/references/platform/eai-service-patterns.md`,
   `.specify/references/platform/eai-repo-contract.md`, and
   `.specify/references/platform/eai.md`.
2. Run `eai --describe` before assuming current CLI syntax.
3. Run `eai agent guide --format json` when advertised.
4. Run `eai resources schema --format json` and
   `eai workflow readiness --format json` when advertised and relevant.
5. Record candidate services in `service-fit-matrix.md`.
6. Prefer EAI Platform services before Azure.
7. Use non-EAI platforms only as explicit exceptions.
8. Keep private tenant IDs, secrets, and `.env` values out of artifacts.

## Step 0: Context Health Check

Before starting research, assess context window health:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/check-context-health.sh
```

- If **< 50%**: Proceed normally
- If **50-70%**: Consider compacting after this stage completes
- If **> 70%**: Start a new session with a handoff summary

Research is typically the heaviest context stage - monitor usage.

---

## Step 0.5: Load Discovery Context (If Available)

Check if discovery.md exists for this feature:

```bash
ls -la .specify/specs/{feature}/discovery.md 2>/dev/null
ls -la .specify/specs/{feature}/eai-preflight.md 2>/dev/null
```

If discovery.md exists:

1. **Load the discovery findings** to inform research focus:
   - Problem Statement → Focus research on solving this specific problem
   - Target Users → Research UX patterns appropriate for these users
   - Value Proposition → Research metrics and measurement approaches
   - Competitive Analysis → If researched, focus on differentiation
   - Application Classification → Determine whether a four-step AI-augmented
     app journey is required
   - AI-Augmented Journey → If app delivery, preserve the four-step-or-fewer
     journey as the scope spine for research
   - EAI Preflight → If present, preserve CLI install/login/tenant/template/app
     readiness decisions and do not re-ask for information already confirmed
   - Shared numbered-stage contract → if non-app, preserve the current shared
     stages without adding app-only preview or service-fit requirements

2. **Use discovery to guide agent prompts**:
   - Codebase Locator: Focus on areas related to the discovered problem
   - Codebase Analyzer: Analyze patterns relevant to target users
   - Pattern Finder: Find examples that deliver similar value
   - AI Pattern Finder: Find existing chatbot, voice, accessibility,
     translation, contextual prefill, recommendation, validation, or
     human-review patterns that can support each journey step

3. **Load discovery memories** via MemoryManager if available:
   ```
   Category: 'discovery'
   Tags: ['#feature-{id}']
   ```

If no discovery.md exists, proceed with standard research flow.

---

## Step 1: Get Feature Context

If no feature description provided in $ARGUMENTS:

1. Ask: **"What feature or change would you like to work on?"**
2. Wait for user response

Once you have the feature description:

1. **Generate a short name** (2-4 words) for the feature
2. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "$DESCRIPTION"` with
   `--short-name "your-short-name"` to create the feature directory
3. Parse JSON output for FEATURE_DIR and BRANCH_NAME

---

## Step 2: Spawn Parallel Research Agents

**CRITICAL**: You **MUST** launch these agents using the Task tool. Do NOT
perform this research work inline in the main context. The main context should
only orchestrate and review agent outputs.

### Agent 1: Codebase Locator

```
Task: subagent_type="codebase-locator", model="haiku"
Prompt: "Find all code related to [FEATURE AREA] in this codebase.
Identify: entry points, related files, directory structure, key classes/functions.
Focus on: [specific aspects from user's description]"
```

### Agent 2: Codebase Analyzer

```
Task: subagent_type="codebase-analyzer", model="sonnet"
Prompt: "Analyze how [RELATED FUNCTIONALITY] is implemented in this codebase.
Explain: architecture patterns, data flow, key abstractions.
Focus on: [how similar features work]"
```

### Agent 3: Pattern Finder

```
Task: subagent_type="codebase-pattern-finder", model="haiku"
Prompt: "Find examples of [PATTERN TYPE] in this codebase.
Show: similar implementations we should model after.
Include: file paths, code snippets, conventions used."
```

**Run all three agents in parallel** for maximum efficiency in standard/full
mode. In fast mode, collapse this into one concise locator/summarizer unless
the feature touches a full-depth risk label. In dynamic mode, do not start broad
fanout yet; have these agents identify candidate shards, unresolved ownership,
and evidence needed before P3 builds the workflow DAG.

---

## Step 2.5: Multi-Perspective Research (Optional)

After the core research agents complete, optionally run additional perspective
strategies for deeper analysis. **Skip this step if the feature is
straightforward or time-constrained.** For dynamic mode, use this step to test
the proposed shard boundaries and stop conditions, not to execute the shards.

### Strategy #6: Research Perspective Multiplier

When the feature involves complex integration or unfamiliar territory, spawn 5
perspective agents:

```
Task: subagent_type="research-perspective-multiplier", model="haiku"
Prompt: "Research [TOPIC] from perspective [1-5].
Perspective 1: Existing codebase patterns
Perspective 2: Open-source project approaches
Perspective 3: Latest documentation/guides
Perspective 4: Anti-patterns to avoid
Perspective 5: Emerging approaches
Context: [summary of feature and existing research findings]"
```

Run all 5 perspectives in parallel, then synthesize with judge:

```
Task: subagent_type="multi-perspective-judge", model="opus"
Prompt: "Judge verdict type: research synthesis.
Synthesize these 5 research perspectives into a unified recommendation.
[paste all 5 agent outputs]"
```

### Strategy #9: Dependency Evaluator

When the research proposes new dependencies, evaluate each one:

```
Task: subagent_type="research-dependency-evaluator", model="haiku"
Prompt: "Evaluate [LIBRARY NAME] from perspective [1-3].
Perspective 1: Evaluate the proposed library
Perspective 2: Find alternatives
Perspective 3: Estimate building without it
Needed functionality: [what we need from it]"
```

Run all 3 perspectives in parallel, then synthesize with judge:

```
Task: subagent_type="multi-perspective-judge", model="opus"
Prompt: "Judge verdict type: dependency decision.
Decide whether to adopt, find alternative, or build in-house.
[paste all 3 agent outputs]"
```

### Strategy #20: Technology Horizon Scanner

For features touching evolving technology areas:

```
Task: subagent_type="research-horizon-scanner", model="haiku"
Prompt: "Scan for emerging alternatives and approaches relevant to [TOPIC].
Current approach: [what we're considering]
Tech stack: [relevant technologies]"
```

This is a single agent — no judge synthesis needed. Include findings in the
research document.

---

## Step 3: Technology Research

While waiting for agents, research any technology questions:

1. **Identify unknowns** from the feature description:
   - New libraries or frameworks needed?
   - Integration patterns to research?
   - Best practices to follow?

2. **Research each unknown** (use WebSearch if needed):
   - Decision: [what to use]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives: [what else considered]

---

## Step 3.5: Competitive Analysis Stage Flag (Optional, Run-Level)

Before drafting `research.md`, resolve competitive-analysis behavior for the
run:

- Treat competitive analysis as an explicit stage flag:
  `includeCompetitiveAnalysis` (alias: `competitiveAnalysisEnabled`).
- Default for `workflowProfile=enterpriseai`: `includeCompetitiveAnalysis=true`.
- Allow per-run override to disable competitive analysis without blocking the
  rest of the pipeline.
- Always generate `business-analysis.md` for EnterpriseAI runs.
- Always generate `market-analysis.md` for EnterpriseAI runs.
- When competitive analysis is disabled:
  - Record `competitiveAnalysisEnabled=false` in research outputs.
  - Keep `market-analysis.md` as a baseline traceability artifact with
    disabled-state messaging (no comparative metrics).
  - Continue to `/2_gofer_specify` normally (no stage failure).

When enabled, `market-analysis.md` must include:

- At least 3 alternatives.
- Explicit EnterpriseAI-selected direction rationale.
- Traceability indicators for downstream `spec.md` and `plan.md` references.

---

## Step 3.6: Context Bundle and Reuse-Before-Create Scan

The standard Gofer workflow is the public default. When `workflowProfile` is
explicitly `enterpriseai`, generate:

1. `{FEATURE_DIR}/context-bundle.md`
   - Feature summary and approved business scenario.
   - Application classification: app delivery or non-app work, with rationale.
   - Four-step-or-fewer AI-augmented journey summary when app delivery applies.
   - AI-readable blocks bridge summary: external/internal/hybrid profile
     choice, package lane, coupling status, public-readiness target, and block
     porting posture.
   - Relevant existing specs, code paths, platform references, and API surfaces.
   - EAI preflight summary: CLI version, login/account status, tenant readiness,
     template initialization state, app enrollment readiness, block catalog
     readiness, and next action. Do not include tokens, secrets, tenant-private
     payloads, or `.env.local` values.
   - EnterpriseAI object types, tenant assumptions, deployment target, and
     validation criteria.
   - A compact "what the next agent needs" section to avoid dumping entire
     source files into later stages.
2. `{FEATURE_DIR}/reuse-scan.md`
   - Existing object types, APIs/events, workflows, modules, specs, and
     reference implementations that may satisfy the need.
   - Existing AI assistance capabilities: chat, voice, accessibility,
     translation, contextual prefill, recommendation, validation, completion
     checks, audit logging, and escalation.
   - Existing UI block/package assets, Storybook story IDs, theme override
     points, and source-platform dependencies that affect reuse, porting, or decoupling.
   - EAI Platform/Azure stack fit for every app-delivery capability. Treat EAI
     Platform services as primary evidence, Azure as the preferred supporting
     substrate, and unrelated app stacks as exceptions only.
   - Decision for each candidate: reuse, extend, or create new.
   - Rationale, evidence path, and stakeholder/architecture owner if a new
     platform concept is recommended.
3. `{FEATURE_DIR}/ui-preview-brief.md` (application delivery only)
   - MVP preview scope: target users, must-have screens, target workflow, and
     the smallest useful UI slice to show first.
   - Package profile: selected external/internal/hybrid profile choice, package
     lane, coupling status, public-readiness target, and why that lane is
     appropriate for this feature.
   - EAI App Template constraint map: which approved template blocks or layout
     patterns the preview should use before any create-new UI concept is
     considered.
   - Block catalog evidence: run `eai --describe`, `eai blocks list`,
     `eai blocks describe <id>` for each candidate, and
     `eai resources schema --format json`; record stable block IDs, required resources,
     data/action bindings, Storybook story IDs, theme override points, package
     lane, coupling status, and any custom-block exception that needs approval.
   - Block porting and source-platform decoupling evidence: identify whether
     each selected block is reused as-is, ported into a package lane, or
     blocked by source-platform coupling; define the adapter/resource-schema
     boundary for any decoupling work.
   - Public-readiness evidence: for external or hybrid profiles, capture package
     exports, consumer-facing constraints, accessibility/theming expectations,
     and what still prevents public consumption.
   - Branding inputs: whether client styling, logos, colors, copy tone, or
     other corporate-brand artifacts must be applied.
   - Fast preview runtime: the repo runner command or URL, expected local URL,
     integrated-browser vs external-browser fallback, and the exact invocation
     to run after every UI-facing change. Prefer `./run.sh dev 3001` on
     macOS/Linux/Codespaces and `run.bat dev 3001` on Windows:
     ```bash
     node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-ui-preview.mjs --feature-dir {FEATURE_DIR} --command "./run.sh dev 3001" --open auto --screenshot --change "<change summary>"
     ```
   - Preview validation plan: what opened-browser, screenshot, browser-render,
     or Playwright-style self-review evidence must exist before Gofer presents
     the preview to the stakeholder.
   - Non-app runs MUST skip this artifact and record "Not applicable" in
     `research.md`.
4. `{FEATURE_DIR}/eai-preflight.md` (EAI app delivery only, created by
   `/0_gofer_start` when possible and updated here when missing or stale)
   - Verify the safe public EAI source set used for research:
     `https://eai-support.github.io/eai/docs/overview`,
     `https://eai-support.github.io/eai/docs/api-reference`,
     `https://eai-support.github.io/eai/registry/`,
     `https://eai-support.github.io/eai/scenarios`, and
     `https://github.com/eai-support/eai-app-template`.
   - Record whether `eai --describe` found the expected scaffolding,
     authentication, tenant, app, resource schema, workflow
     readiness, block catalog, diagnostics, Gofer-refresh, and template-check
     commands.
   - Record whether `eai update --check` reports the installed CLI is current
     or requires an upgrade before app delivery proceeds.
   - Record whether the app template markers exist:
     `src/eai.config/object-types.ts`, `src/eai.config/register.ts`,
     `.env.example`, `.npmrc`, and `package.json`.
   - Record whether the current repo is ready for `eai verify`, needs
     `eai init <app-name>`, or must avoid scaffolding because it is a non-empty
     non-EAI repo.
   - Record whether `eai template check --format json` and `eai gofer refresh
     --check --format json` succeed, report drift, or return `E001` because the
     repo is not yet an EAI app project.
   - Record the app stack policy decision: EAI Platform including the EAI app
     template first, Azure second, or approved non-EAI exception.
   - Record the selected package profile and block-catalog readiness evidence
     from `eai blocks list`, `eai blocks readiness`, and selected
     `eai blocks describe <id>` calls.
   - Record resource provisioning state, object-type publish state,
     schema/storage health state, workflow readiness, last completed gate,
     blocked gate, and next recovery command so later stages inherit the real
     platform lifecycle instead of guessing.
   - Use `.specify/references/platform/eai-repo-contract.md` and
     `.specify/references/platform/eai-error-catalog.yaml` whenever recovery,
     command ordering, or drift handling is unclear.
   - Record only product-safe status labels such as `ready`,
     `account_required`, `login_required`, `tenant_required`,
     `operator_required`, `template_required`, `user_confirmation_required`,
     or `not_applicable`.

Do not recommend a new EnterpriseAI object type, API/event, workflow, or module
until the reuse-before-create scan is complete. Do not recommend a non-EAI app
runtime, database, hosting platform, or primary service as the default app
substrate; use it only as an explicit integration/migration reference or
approved exception after the EAI Platform/Azure fit has been evaluated.

---

## Step 4: Synthesize Findings

Once all agents complete:

1. **Compile findings** from all sources
2. **Identify key integration points** in the codebase
3. **Document patterns to follow** from existing code
4. **Note constraints and considerations**
5. **Distill business scenario options and architecture recommendations** for
   user review before specification

### Structured Discovery Outputs (MANDATORY)

`research.md` MUST include all of the following in explicit sections:

1. **Structured Problem Statement**
   - Problem summary
   - Current state friction
   - Desired EnterpriseAI-oriented outcome
2. **Structured Target Persona**
   - Primary persona name/role
   - Skill level (novice/intermediate/advanced)
   - Primary needs and constraints
3. **Structured Value Proposition**
   - Primary value delivered
   - Quantified or measurable goal
   - Why this should be EnterpriseAI-first
4. **Application-Delivery Gate Summary** (app delivery only)
   - Preview-first rationale and the smallest useful MVP to show first
   - EAI App Template reuse constraints and any approved extension gaps
   - External/internal/hybrid profile choice, package lane, coupling status,
     public-readiness target, block-porting needs, and source-platform decoupling status
   - Candidate capability-discovery inputs for the later service-fit gate
   - Non-app runs must explicitly state "Not applicable"
5. **Goal Ledger Seed**
   - Goal IDs, business outcomes, metrics, targets, owners, and confidence
   - Delivery states for any capability that starts mock/hybrid before going live
   - Re-loop triggers for objective drift, assumption expiry, contract drift,
     UX scope changes, and post-validation code/test movement
6. **Loop Contract Seed**
   - Initialize `{FEATURE_DIR}/loop-contract.json` if it is missing:
     `node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-loop-audit.mjs --feature-dir {FEATURE_DIR} --stage 1_research --init --json`
   - Align the loop objective, maximum iterations, evaluation commands, success
     criteria, stop conditions, and human escalation rules with the research
     risk profile.
   - Keep the default contract for ordinary work, but tighten it for
     release-critical, security, data, auth, platform, or cross-repo work.

### Novice Walkthrough Guardrail (MANDATORY)

Assume a novice user can read only in-repo/generated artifacts.

- Do not require external docs to understand or act on research output.
- Explain terms and recommendations in plain language before advanced details.

---

## Step 4.5: Generate Research Visuals (Persona Pack — US4)

After synthesis, dispatch the visual writers in parallel to produce the
research-stage visuals. These run AFTER research findings are compiled so they
can cite real integration points and capability mentions, but BEFORE
`research.md` is finalized so the writers can append cross-references to the
generated artefacts.

Run two sub-agents concurrently:

1. **`visual-c4-writer`** (Context level only at this stage)
   - Inputs:
     - `<feature_dir>/research.md` (working draft)
     - `<feature_dir>/discovery.md` (if present)
     - Template: `.specify/templates/visuals/c4-context-template.md`
   - Output: `<feature_dir>/visuals/c4-context.md`
   - Required: Mermaid `C4Context` block with named external systems and at
     least one Person; plain-language preamble ≥30 ≤200 words.

2. **`visual-heatmap-writer`** (Capability heatmap)
   - Inputs:
     - `<feature_dir>/research.md` (working draft)
     - Template: `.specify/templates/visuals/capability-heatmap-template.md`
   - Output: `<feature_dir>/visuals/capability-heatmap.md`
   - Required: Mermaid `quadrantChart` placing each capability on maturity ×
     strategic-value axes plus tabular complement listing touched / extended /
     replaced capabilities.

Both writers must honour the ≥30 ≤200 word plain-language preamble rule
(NFR-010). If a renderer fails downstream, the `mermaid-tabular-fallback.mjs`
helper provides a markdown-table replacement without losing information.

Cross-reference the generated artefacts from `research.md` (Step 5) under a new
`## Visuals` section.

`````

---

## Step 6: Review, Discuss, and Hand Off To Specification

Before presenting the handoff, update the stakeholder-facing product release
PR/FAQ artifacts:

1. Create or update `{FEATURE_DIR}/working-backwards-prfaq.md` from
   `.specify/templates/working-backwards-prfaq-template.md`.
   - Fill the Press Release with the best current customer problem, launch
     promise, customer benefit, and "How To Get Started" story from research.
   - Fill External FAQ with researched customer/process evidence and mark
     unknown claims as `Pending research validation` instead of inventing them.
   - Fill Internal FAQ Business Owner and CTO sections with research options,
     platform constraints, and architecture trade-offs.
2. Write an immutable snapshot to
   `{FEATURE_DIR}/prfaq-history/01-research.md`.
3. Create or update `{FEATURE_DIR}/business-owner-summary.md` from
   `.specify/templates/business-owner-summary-template.md` using
   `problem-brief.md`, `discovery.md`, `research.md`, value-stream, and ROI
   evidence when present. If `spec-summary.md` or `business-metrics.md` does
   not exist yet, keep the relevant rows and mark status `Pending /2 or /7a`.
4. For application delivery, create or update `{FEATURE_DIR}/build-map.md`
   from `.specify/templates/build-map-template.md`.
   - Keep the picture simple enough for a business owner to follow.
   - Mark the EAI Platform, app experience, data/workflow, security, integration,
     and preview/release areas as `not started`, `working`, `ready`,
     `blocked`, or `needs decision`.
   - In the latest update, state what was learned, why it matters, and the next
     decision or stage in plain language.
5. Update `{FEATURE_DIR}/stakeholder-review-index.md` from
   `.specify/templates/stakeholder-review-index-template.md` and mark the
   Business Owner and CTO review asks that should be answered before or during
   `/2_gofer_specify`.

After saving `research.md`, `goal-ledger.json`, `proposal-review.md`, and the
PR/FAQ review artifacts:

1. **Present summary** to user:
   - What was found
   - Which build-map areas are now understood, blocked, or waiting for a
     decision
   - Business scenarios considered
   - Recommended business scenario
   - Recommended architecture direction
   - Options and trade-offs
   - Any open questions needing input

2. **Ask focused follow-up questions only if needed**:
   - Clarify the preferred business scenario if the research found real alternatives
   - Clarify the preferred architecture direction if the trade-off is still ambiguous
   - Confirm whether the user wants to stop after research or continue into specification

3. **Run architecture questions one-by-one (MANDATORY when architecture options
   exist)**:
   - Ask exactly ONE architecture question at a time using AskUserQuestion
   - After each answer, ask whether the user wants to discuss that question
     before locking the answer
   - If the user asks clarifying questions, answer them first, then re-ask the
     same question for a final decision
   - Record the final answer in `proposal-review.md` before moving to the next
     question
   - Never bundle multiple architecture decisions into a single prompt

   Suggested order:
   1. Confirm preferred architecture option
   2. Confirm the key trade-off priority (speed, flexibility, reliability, cost)
   3. Confirm non-negotiable constraints/integration boundaries

4. **If the user requests changes**:
   - Update `proposal-review.md` with the feedback in
     `User Feedback and Overrides`
   - Set `status: revised_supporting_context` if the recommendation must change
   - Revise the recommendation before continuing

5. **If the user wants to stop after research**:
   - End after summarizing the current findings
   - Do not auto-chain until the user explicitly asks to continue

6. **Signal completion**:

```

✓ Research complete: {FEATURE_DIR}/research.md
✓ Goal ledger seeded: {FEATURE_DIR}/goal-ledger.json
✓ Loop contract seeded: {FEATURE_DIR}/loop-contract.json
✓ Working Backwards PR/FAQ updated: {FEATURE_DIR}/working-backwards-prfaq.md
✓ PR/FAQ research snapshot: {FEATURE_DIR}/prfaq-history/01-research.md
✓ Business Owner summary draft: {FEATURE_DIR}/business-owner-summary.md
✓ Stakeholder review index updated: {FEATURE_DIR}/stakeholder-review-index.md
✓ Supporting review context ready: {FEATURE_DIR}/proposal-review.md

Key findings:

- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]

```

Unless the user explicitly asks to stop after research or a real gate blocks
progress, read and follow `.specify/commands/2_gofer_specify.md` in the same
conversation after the required research evidence, summary and critical
clarification answers are captured. Apply the Continuation And Stop Contract.
For requested research-only work, report that scope complete without claiming
the delivery pipeline is complete. Do not ask for a numbered command.

## Step 6.5: Brownfield/Legacy Analysis (For Existing Codebases)

When working in an existing codebase, add this section to research.md:

```markdown
## Brownfield Analysis

### Constraints & Limitations

| Constraint Type   | Description                               | Impact on Implementation       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Framework         | [e.g., React 17 - no concurrent features] | [How this limits our approach] |
| Database          | [e.g., PostgreSQL 12, existing schema]    | [Schema constraints]           |
| API Compatibility | [e.g., Must maintain v1 endpoints]        | [Backward compatibility needs] |
| Performance       | [e.g., Response time < 200ms]             | [Optimization requirements]    |

### Technical Debt to Avoid

The following patterns are deprecated or problematic - do NOT use:

| Pattern       | Found In          | Why Avoid | Use Instead          |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| [Old pattern] | `path/to/file.ts` | [Reason]  | [Preferred approach] |

### Areas Requiring Extra Caution

- **[Area 1]**: [Why it's fragile and what to watch for]
- **[Area 2]**: [Known issues or gotchas]

### Integration Requirements

| Existing Service | Integration Method | Notes                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| [Service 1]      | [API/Import/Event] | [Authentication, format, etc.] |

### Downstream Dependencies

Code that depends on areas we're modifying:

- `path/to/dependent.ts:45` - [What it depends on]
- `path/to/consumer.ts:123` - [What it expects]
```

### Brownfield Checklist

Before modifying existing code:

- [ ] Understand current behavior (read and trace code flow)
- [ ] Document what must NOT change (protected boundaries)
- [ ] Identify downstream dependencies
- [ ] Add characterization tests if modifying complex logic
- [ ] Plan rollback strategy for risky changes

---

## Step 6.5: Journey Variant Generation (Optional)

**If a base journey exists** at
`.specify/specs/{feature}/journeys/base-journey.md`:

Generate industry variants to discover innovative approaches from other domains.

### Generate Variant Count

Pick a random number between 10-50:

```bash
VARIANT_COUNT=$((RANDOM % 41 + 10))
echo "Generating $VARIANT_COUNT industry variants"
```

### Load Industry Templates

Read `.specify/templates/journey/industry-variants.yaml` for industry-specific
patterns.

### Generate Variants

For each variant, create a file at:
`.specify/specs/{feature}/journeys/variants/{industry}-{number}.md`

Example: `healthcare-1.md`, `retail-2.md`, `finance-1.md`

**Distribute proportionally across 10 industries:**

- retail, healthcare, finance, education, hospitality
- logistics, manufacturing, legal, real_estate, entertainment

**Each variant should include:**

````markdown
---
id: {feature}-{industry}-{number}
baseJourneyId: {feature}-journey
industry: {industry}
variantNumber: {number}
created: {ISO-timestamp}
---

# Journey Variant: {Industry} #{number}

## Base Journey Reference

Based on: [base-journey.md](../base-journey.md)

## Industry Context

{Description of how this industry typically handles similar journeys}

## Adaptations

{How the base journey is adapted for this industry}

1. **Step N adapted**: {How step N changes in this industry}
2. **Actor change**: {Different actors in this industry context}

## Innovation Insights

Key innovations from {industry} that could apply to your feature:

1. **{Innovation 1}**: {Description and how it could be applied}
2. **{Innovation 2}**: {Description and how it could be applied}

## Modified Diagram

```mermaid

    {Industry-specific sequence diagram}
```
````

## Potential Application

How these insights could enhance your feature:

- {Specific suggestion 1}
- {Specific suggestion 2}

````

### Document Innovation Summary

Add an "Innovation Insights" section to `research.md`:

```markdown
## Innovation Insights (from Industry Variants)

Generated {N} journey variants across 10 industries.

### Top Innovations to Consider

| Industry | Innovation | Application Potential |
|----------|------------|----------------------|
| Healthcare | AI symptom checker | Could add AI-powered input validation |
| Finance | Real-time fraud detection | Could add anomaly detection |
| Retail | Personalized recommendations | Could add user-specific suggestions |

### Variant Summary

| Industry | Count | Key Patterns |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| Retail | 5 | Cart recovery, recommendations |
| Healthcare | 4 | Patient portal, telehealth |
| ... | ... | ... |
````

### Skip Conditions

Skip variant generation if:

1. No base journey exists (user skipped journey mapping)
2. Feature is purely technical (no user-facing journey)
3. Context window is at Warning level (>50%)

---

## Step 7: Observability Logging

At stage completion, log metrics:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/log-stage.sh 1_research --complete --tokens [N] --compactions [N]
```

This tracks:

- Stage duration
- Token usage

## Important Notes

- **All output goes to `.specify/specs/{feature}/`** - not thoughts/shared/
- **Run agents in parallel** for efficiency
- **Include specific file paths and line numbers** for all references
- **Structured Problem Statement + Persona + Value Proposition are required** in
  `research.md`
- **Research must remain usable by novices without external docs**
- **Research should inform specification directly** - focus on what helps users
  discuss the business scenario and architecture before `spec.md` is written
- **Maximum 5 open questions** - make informed decisions for the rest
- **Use `proposal-review.md` as optional supporting context, not as a blocking stage**
- **Log stage completion** for observability tracking

## Optional Helpers: Vocabulary Extraction and Zoom-Out

If the operator explicitly requests the `vocabulary` selector after
`research.md` exists, run `gofer:vocabulary` inline and write
`.specify/specs/{feature}/glossary.md` using the same artifact contract as the
standalone helper.

If the operator explicitly requests the `zoom-out` selector after `research.md`
exists, run `gofer:zoom-out` inline and write
`.specify/specs/{feature}/zoom-out-report.md` using the same artifact contract
as the standalone helper.

If `research.md` is missing, continue the stage normally and report that the
helper was not run.

These selectors are optional and do not change stage progress, routing, or
pipeline state.

## Local Settings Cleanup Contract
<!-- gofer:local-settings-cleanup:start -->

After any Gofer install, update, release refresh, or workspace bootstrap:

1. Archive stale Gofer command and skill entries before continuing.
2. Prefer the repo helper:
   - `node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-local-settings-cleanup.mjs --workspace . --apply --json`
3. If the repo helper is missing, use the stable plugin bundle helper:
   - macOS/Linux: `node ~/plugins/eai-gofer/.specify/scripts/node/gofer-local-settings-cleanup.mjs --workspace . --apply --json`
   - Windows: `node %USERPROFILE%\plugins\eai-gofer\.specify\scripts\node\gofer-local-settings-cleanup.mjs --workspace . --apply --json`
4. This cleanup covers old Claude, Codex, Copilot, Gemini, Grok, VS Code, desktop, and CLI command surfaces.
5. Do not remove the current public `eai` entrypoint.
6. Ask the user to refresh or restart the host command picker only after cleanup completes.
<!-- gofer:local-settings-cleanup:end -->
