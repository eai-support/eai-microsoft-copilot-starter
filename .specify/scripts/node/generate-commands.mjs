Apply this contract to every request after Gofer is installed for this repo or AI coding app. The user does not need to type \`/eai\`, \`$eai\`, or \`#eai\`.

1. Preserve the user's request. Do not rewrite it or add a visible command prefix.
2. Treat an explicit \`/eai\`, \`$eai\`, or \`#eai\` prefix as an idempotent request for the same contract.
3. Apply the Controlled English Contract to every Gofer-authored message and artifact.
4. Keep the reply short unless the user asks for detail.
5. Explain the business effect first.
6. Put technical evidence in durable artifacts.
7. Do not make the user choose pipeline stages. Select the next internal stage yourself.
8. Do not repeat workspace setup on every message. Check it before meaningful repo work, tool use, or a pipeline stage.
9. Keep the update and installation path separate. When the user explicitly asks to update Gofer, run only its maintenance contract.

2. Use concise, simple language.
3. Include technical detail only when it supports a decision or the user asks for it.
4. If any check fails, rewrite the reply before sending it.

${buildDeliveryDisciplineContract()}`;
}

export function buildDeliveryDisciplineContract() {
  return `**Business Updates And Goal Checks**

Use \`.specify/references/business-updates-and-goal-checks.md\`. Before each reply, explain the result, business effect, and next action in plain language. For progress, use two or three short sentences. Run \`node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-response-check.mjs --input <private-draft-file>\` before sending a drafted progress update; rewrite failed drafts. Use \`--kind answer\` for answers and \`--technical\` only when technical detail was requested. Do not repeat unchanged progress. This helper cannot intercept messages that the host sends directly.

Before each work batch, read the current goal, specification, tasks, and latest findings. After new knowledge or an approved change, update affected feature documents and explain the effect. Never weaken acceptance criteria to match failing code or invent user approval. Mark a task complete only after its linked checks pass; reopen affected tasks when evidence is stale. For app and non-app features with a spec and tasks, enable \`requireDeliveryCheckpoint\` in \`loop-contract.json\` and run \`node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-delivery-check.mjs --feature-dir <feature-dir>\` before advancing or claiming completion. Follow the reference to capture a reviewed checkpoint, not merely to clear a failure. Keep existing MVP exemptions, reviews, loops, and release gates. Conversation-only requests need no feature files.

**Priority And Outcome Protection**

Follow \`.specify/references/priority-outcome-protection.md\`. Before implementing a task, record the latest material user direction in decisions.md and maintain priority-plan.json with ordered tasks, dependencies, allowedEditScope and the current outcome. Enable requirePriorityPlan for new feature contracts. Run \`node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-priority-check.mjs --feature-dir <feature-dir> --task T001\` before the action, and include --workspace <repo-root> plus --changed-file for each proposed or actual changed repo-relative path. Follow its nextTask; only recorded prerequisites and approved parallel work may precede the current priority. Do not switch to unrelated work when blocked. On resume, state the agreed outcome and next task in plain language after reading the last recorded direction. Keep routine conversation free of feature paperwork.

Before technical escalation, attach fresh diagnosis through the blocker helper's ask event verification field. Check the exact command, route, environment, own mistake and existing authority. Do not invent a tenant, ask for login without checking it, require an unsafe alternative, or equate administrator access with permission. Business decisions need no failing command. At completion, run the priority checker with --finish; a missing or stale outcome receipt means unverified, regardless of test scores. Use --completion for the final gofer-closed-loop-audit.mjs run; a routine drift audit alone does not prove completion. Preserve detailed test results, early local MVP scope, non-app work, independent approved tasks and all release/security checks.`;

2. Classify the request as conversation, research/docs/audit, EAI app delivery, or ambiguous.
3. For conversation or research/docs/audit, continue the non-app Gofer path after the one required non-app confirmation.
4. For EAI app delivery or ambiguous app work, continue directly into EAI readiness.

1. Create \`.specify/specs/{feature}/\` before app or operator-tool source work.
2. Keep \`spec.md\`, \`plan.md\`, \`tasks.md\`, \`traceability.md\`, and the validation scope aligned.
3. Mark each relevant capability as \`not_applicable\`, \`planned\`, \`implemented\`, \`verified\`, or \`blocked\`.
4. Require evidence only for an implemented capability or a capability required by the current delivery decision.
5. Treat \`run.sh\`, \`run.bat\`, and \`run.ps1\` as launch evidence only. They do not prove authentication, sessions, EAI access, or deployment readiness.
6. For a user-facing change, store the local HTTP check, screenshot, and review outcome in the feature validation report.
7. If browser validation is blocked, mark that user journey \`unverified\`. Do not call it complete.
8. If the user changes scope, update the feature artifacts before continuing. Explain what changed, what remains valid, and what now needs evidence.
9. Use truthful completion language. For example: \`The server runs. Authentication is not in the current MVP scope.\`
10. When the feature claims a release or deployed outcome, create \`release-capability-ledger.md\` from \`.specify/templates/release-capability-ledger-template.md\`.
11. Do not report a release complete or score 100% when a required capability is missing from traceability, remains on an open PR, is absent from the release branch, or lacks required deployed evidence.`;

Do not invent, guess, or complete EAI CLI commands from memory.

1. Before you suggest or run an \`eai ...\` command, verify the exact command from the installed CLI.
2. Start with \`eai --describe\` and use its command map as the source of truth.
3. For a specific command, run \`eai <command> --help\` or the CLI-described equivalent before using flags, subcommands, or examples.
4. Use \`eai agent guide --format json\` when the CLI advertises it.
5. Use \`eai errors explain <code-or-reason> --format json\` after errors when the CLI advertises it.
6. If the command is not listed or help fails, do not run it. Say the installed EAI CLI does not expose that command, then choose a safe listed command or ask the user to update EAI CLI.
7. Record the verified command and source in \`eai-preflight.md\`, \`service-fit-matrix.md\`, or the active feature notes before the command changes files or external systems.
8. For commands that create, deploy, publish, mutate tenants, change Entra, or spend money, confirm with the user after verification and before execution.`;

function buildEaiPlatformDecisionSection() {
  return `## EAI Platform Decision Contract

For app delivery, make EAI Platform choices for the business user.

1. Read \`.specify/references/platform/eai-service-patterns.md\`, \`.specify/references/platform/eai-repo-contract.md\`, and \`.specify/references/platform/eai.md\` before architecture or storage decisions.
2. Run \`eai --describe\` before assuming current CLI syntax.
3. Run \`eai agent guide --format json\` when the CLI advertises it.
4. Run \`eai resources schema --format json\` and \`eai workflow readiness --format json\` when advertised and relevant.
5. Create or update \`.specify/specs/{feature}/service-fit-matrix.md\`.
6. Prefer the EAI app template, PublicAPI, ResourceAPI, object types, workflows, goals, targets, platform AI services, and tenant identity.
7. Prefer PostgreSQL for relational, transactional, reporting, and workflow state.
8. Prefer DocumentDB for flexible JSON documents, nested records, and high-change document models.
9. Prefer Blob Storage for large files and binary content behind API-mediated access.
10. Prefer AI Search as a derived search projection, not as the source of record.
11. Prefer EAI content understanding and document services for classification, extraction, summarization, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
12. Prefer EAI workflows, goals, and targets for approvals, long-running work, service goals, operating targets, and auditable process state.
13. Use Azure second when the EAI Platform does not yet expose the needed capability.
14. Use any other platform only as an explicit exception with rationale, owner, expiry, and validation evidence.
15. Ask the user only for material business, security, cost, deployment, destructive, or external-system decisions.`;

Use this as the single user-facing Gofer command. Apply its contract to every request after Gofer is installed. An explicit \`/${entry.name}\`, \`$${entry.name}\`, or \`#${entry.name}\` prefix is optional. Do not ask users to run numbered stage commands unless they explicitly request low-level internals.

## User-Facing Contract

- Keep the command window simple: expose \`eai\` only.
- Treat \`.specify/commands/*.md\` as internal stage contracts, not user-facing commands.
- Keep all Gofer functions available by routing internally to the right stage contract.
- Explain progress in business language first; provide technical details when the user asks.

## Controlled English Contract

Use ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English as the target writing standard for all Gofer-authored chat, documents, commands, summaries, PR notes, error guidance, and validation artifacts. ASD-STE100 is copyright and a trademark of ASD; do not bundle the protected ASD dictionary and do not claim ASD certification.

Apply these rules before any user-facing output:

1. Use short sentences. Keep instructions to 20 words or fewer where possible.
2. Use one action per instruction.
3. Use active voice. Use passive voice only when the actor is unknown or not important.
4. Use simple present, simple past, simple future, infinitive, or imperative verb forms.
5. Use approved project terms and necessary technical nouns only. Define acronyms on first use.
6. Use direct words. Avoid idioms, marketing adjectives, vague praise, and hedging.
7. Use vertical lists for complex information.
8. Put one topic in each paragraph.
9. For errors, write: what happened, why it matters, what to do next, and the exact safe command when one exists.
10. Keep raw logs, stack traces, IDs, and secrets out of chat unless the user asks for technical detail.

${buildAlwaysEaiSection()}

## Workspace Preflight

1. Resolve the repository root.
2. Run \`node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-workspace-check.mjs --host ${host} --json\` when available.
3. If the repo is missing or stale, ask exactly: **"This repo is missing or stale for Gofer. Initialize/update it now?"**
4. If the user says yes, run \`node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-workspace-bootstrap.mjs --host ${host} --include-mirrors\`, then resume this command.
5. If the user says no, stop and explain that Gofer needs the repo scaffold before it can safely continue.

${buildAppPreviewRunnerContractSection()}

${buildJourneyStateSection()}

${buildMvpCapabilityValidationSection()}

${buildAuthAccessDecisionContract()}

## App vs Non-App Routing

1. Classify the request before EAI readiness: EAI app delivery, non-application work, or ambiguous.
2. If the request is EAI app delivery or ambiguous, continue directly into the EAI app delivery path; do not ask for confirmation just because app delivery is inferred.
3. If the request is clearly non-app work, confirm once: **"This looks like non-app work, so I will skip EAI tenant/app setup and continue the Gofer research/docs path. Is that right?"**
4. When the user confirms non-app, do not run \`eai whoami\`, tenant selection, \`eai init\`, or first-run setup. Record the decision and continue the appropriate Gofer research, documentation, audit, migration, or planning path.
5. If the user says it is app work, switch to EAI app delivery and run EAI readiness.

## EAI Platform Readiness

1. Run \`eai whoami\` only when the current feature uses EAI Platform services, the user asks for EAI setup, or EAI CLI recovery is needed.
2. Require \`eai-app-template-readiness\`, \`eai verify\`, and \`eai template check --format json\` only when the feature creates, changes, or validates an EAI Platform app integration.
3. Require the authentication journey only when the specification includes sign-in, protected content, user roles, or a deployment target that requires identity.
4. For a local MVP with no EAI or authentication capability, record those states as \`not_applicable\` or \`planned\` and continue with local feature validation.
5. When an EAI capability becomes required, run the first-run/setup path from \`.specify/commands/gofer_eai_first_run.md\`, then require canonical template evidence before that capability can complete.
6. Do not accept copied marker files, a partial scaffold, or a custom template as proof that \`eai init\` completed.
7. After any \`eai\` error, run \`eai errors explain <code-or-reason> --format json\` when available before guessing remediation.
8. Do not write tokens, secrets, private tenant IDs, or local \`.env\` values into artifacts.

${buildVerifiedEaiCliCommandContract()}

${buildEaiPlatformDecisionSection()}

## First Conversation

When this is the first EAI conversation for a new app:

1. Start with the business outcome. Ask what the user needs to achieve, who it is for, and how success will be measured.
2. Explain EAI capabilities only when they help the next decision. Do not begin with platform architecture or a list of tools.
3. Use the repository and EAI CLI as sources of truth. Run \`eai --describe\` before assuming command syntax and explain known errors before recovery.
4. Keep numbered Gofer stages internal. Say what is being learned, designed, built, or checked in business language.
5. Explain why specification-led delivery improves AI quality: it creates a shared, testable statement of the outcome before code changes multiply.
6. Pause once for approval of the business specification. After approval, continue automatically unless a material business, security, cost, deployment, or destructive decision needs approval.
7. Do not create a GitHub repository, deploy, publish, spend money, or change external systems without the relevant user approval.

## Route The Pipeline

1. Read existing feature state from \`.specify/specs/\`, pipeline state files, checkpoints, validation artifacts, and loop evidence.
2. Decide the next internal stage contract needed to move the feature toward completion.
3. If no feature state exists yet, start from \`.specify/commands/0_gofer_start.md\`.
4. Execute the selected stage by following the matching file in \`.specify/commands/\`.
5. Continue through research, specify, plan, tasks, implement, and validate unless a real business, security, release, or user-approval decision blocks progress.
6. When app UI is involved, show the user the working UI as early and as often as practical.
7. Keep stakeholder summaries, build maps, diagrams, loop evidence, tests, and validation artifacts current.

Grok Build has no supported user-level plugin installer or updater. This command cannot install or update EAI Gofer on this host.

## What To Do

1. Add EAI Gofer to the repository from a supported host.
2. Open that repository in Grok Build.
3. Use the repository \`eai\` skill to continue work.

Do not run \`gofer-surface-update.mjs --host grok\`. That host is not supported by the updater.
${buildBlockerMediationContract()}
`;
  }

  return `## Update EAI Gofer

Use this command to install or update EAI Gofer for the current AI coding app. This command works without an EAI project, a Gofer scaffold, or EAI sign-in.

## Update Contract

1. Do not run workspace checks, \`eai init\`, \`eai whoami\`, or pipeline stages.
2. Check the current host first:
   \`node <plugin-root>/.specify/scripts/node/gofer-surface-update.mjs --action inspect --host ${host} --json\`
3. If the plugin root is not known, identify the installed plugin bundle before you run the helper.
4. State whether EAI Gofer is installed and whether the host command is available.
5. Explain the planned user-level change and ask for approval before any install or update command.
6. After approval, run one of these commands from the bundled helper:
   - Install: \`node <plugin-root>/.specify/scripts/node/gofer-surface-update.mjs --action install --host ${host} --execute --json\`
   - Update: \`node <plugin-root>/.specify/scripts/node/gofer-surface-update.mjs --action update --host ${host} --execute --json\`
7. After an actual install or update, the helper archives stale Gofer command and skill entries. It also adds a small managed always-on instruction to the selected host. It keeps the current \`eai\` and \`eai-update\` entries. For Codex, a clean official local marketplace on \`main\` fast-forwards safely. A dirty, non-main, or unrecognised local marketplace remains unchanged and reports that its plugin update is incomplete while it still refreshes the always-on instruction. If the Codex marketplace source is unknown, it stops without changes.
8. Run only the selected host by default. Use \`--host all\` only when the user explicitly asks to install or update every detected host.
9. Show the required reload step from the helper output. Do not claim the command is ready until the host reloads.

## Supported Hosts

- Claude Code: refresh the marketplace and plugin, then run \`/reload-plugins\`.
- Codex: refresh a confirmed Git marketplace and apply the plugin, then start a new task or restart Codex. A clean official local \`main\` checkout fast-forwards and applies the plugin. Other local checkouts keep their work unchanged, refresh the always-on instruction, and report what needs attention. An unknown source stops the update to protect local work.
- GitHub Copilot: refresh the marketplace and plugin, then restart the CLI session or start a new app chat.
- Gemini CLI: update the extension, then start a new Gemini CLI session.
- VS Code: install or update \`EnterpriseAI.gofer\`, then run **Developer: Reload Window**.

## Limits

- This command updates user-level plugins and extensions. It archives known stale Gofer entries and replaces only Gofer's managed instruction section. It does not remove unrelated user files or host-managed plugin caches. It does not add the repo-owned \`.specify/\` scaffold.
- For a repository scaffold, use \`/eai add or refresh the Gofer scaffold for this repo\` after the host update.
- Grok Build has no supported user-level plugin installer. Use its repository skill path after Gofer is added to that repository.
- Keep the full Gofer delivery pipeline unchanged. This command only manages its host installation.

Wait for the answer before changing auth code. An unanswered question must not widen access. Preserve stricter existing rules. Record the answer in the feature spec; do not repeat a confirmed question unless its scope changes.

Confirm the sign-in method separately: EAI sign-in or client SSO through EAI. Verify platform support and CLI syntax; do not invent SSO commands. Enforce trusted server-side workspace membership and app permissions. A session, CIAM directory ID, or email domain alone is not workspace access. Platform-wide sign-in never grants access to another workspace's data. Test allowed and denied users, revoked membership, unavailable membership checks, and cross-tenant requests. These checks apply only when authentication is implemented or required, not to non-app work or an auth-free local MVP.`;

## Application Classification And EAI Preflight

Before any EAI CLI, login, tenant, template, or app-enrollment action:

1. Classify the request as **EAI app delivery** or **non-application work** using the application signals in \`.specify/commands/0_gofer_start.md\`.
2. Create \`.specify/specs/{feature}/\` and record the active delivery scope before app or operator-tool source work.
3. If the request is clearly non-app work, confirm once: **"This looks like non-app work, so I will skip EAI tenant/app setup and continue the Gofer research/docs path. Is that right?"**
4. If the user confirms non-app, record the decision and mark app-only capabilities \`not_applicable\`. Do not run \`eai whoami\`, \`eai tenant select\`, \`eai init\`, or \`/gofer:eai-first-run\`.
5. For local MVP app work, validate the implemented user journey, repo runner, and preview evidence. Do not require EAI setup, authentication, or deployment when the active specification does not require them.
6. When the feature uses EAI Platform services, requires a tenant, or prepares deployment, run \`eai whoami\` and record the EAI readiness evidence in \`eai-preflight.md\`.
7. When the feature creates, changes, or validates an EAI Platform app integration, run \`node .specify/scripts/node/eai-app-template-readiness.mjs --root . --json\`. A missing checker or status other than \`ready\` blocks that EAI capability. It does not block unrelated local MVP work.
8. When authentication is implemented or required, validate provider, callback, sign-in, session, first protected API call, and safe denied access.
9. When deployment is requested or claimed, require the relevant EAI template, security, configuration, and deployment evidence before completion.
10. For durable app delivery, use EAI Platform first, Azure second, and every other stack only by explicit exception.
11. If the user changes scope, update \`spec.md\`, \`plan.md\`, \`tasks.md\`, \`traceability.md\`, and validation scope before continuing. Explain the business effect and evidence change.
12. Do not accept copied marker files, partial scaffolds, or custom templates as readiness evidence for an EAI capability.
13. Do not write tokens, secrets, private tenant IDs, or local \`.env\` values into Gofer artifacts; record only product-safe readiness status and evidence.

## Workspace Preflight

Before doing stage/helper work:

1. Resolve the repository root.
2. Check the core Gofer sentinels:
   - \`.specify/.gofer-version\`
   - \`.specify/commands/0_gofer_start.md\`
   - \`.specify/templates/spec-template.md\`
   - \`.specify/templates/build-map-template.md\`

   - \`.specify/scripts/node/gofer-loop-audit.mjs\`
   - \`.specify/scripts/hooks/post-tool-use.mjs\`
   - \`.specify/scripts/powershell/install-optional-tools.ps1\`

   - \`.specify/scripts/node/gofer-ui-preview.mjs\`
   - \`.specify/specs/\`
   - \`.specify/memory/\`
3. Check host-specific repo-owned files when relevant:
   - Claude: \`AGENTS.md\`, \`CLAUDE.md\`, \`.claude/settings.json\`
   - Codex: \`AGENTS.md\`
   - Copilot: \`.github/copilot-instructions.md\`
   - VS Code extension mirrors Claude/Copilot/Gemini resources itself and should still keep the core scaffold healthy
4. If the repo already has the workspace checker script, prefer running:
   - \`node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-workspace-check.mjs --host ${host} --json\`
5. If the workspace is missing or stale, ask exactly:
   - **"This repo is missing or stale for Gofer. Initialize/update it now?"**
6. If the user says yes, run the Gofer workspace bootstrap helper and then resume this command from the top.
7. After a Gofer install, update, or bootstrap, remove stale local Gofer command entries with:
   - \`node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-local-settings-cleanup.mjs --workspace . --apply --json\`
8. If the cleanup helper is only available in the downloaded bundle, run:
   - macOS/Linux: \`node ~/plugins/eai-gofer/.specify/scripts/node/gofer-local-settings-cleanup.mjs --workspace . --apply --json\`
   - Windows: \`node %USERPROFILE%\\plugins\\eai-gofer\\.specify\\scripts\\node\\gofer-local-settings-cleanup.mjs --workspace . --apply --json\`
9. For EAI app delivery, use the repo runner for local previews:
   - macOS, Linux, and GitHub Codespaces: \`./run.sh dev 3001\`
   - Windows: \`run.bat dev 3001\`
10. Do not start app previews with direct \`npm run dev\` commands when the repo runner exists.
11. If the user says no, stop and explain that Gofer stage/helper work depends on the repo-owned scaffold.${eaiPreflight}

## Token And Cost Policy
<!-- gofer:token-cost-policy:start -->

Before spawning agents, calling tools, or loading large files:

1. Treat \`.specify/memory/gofer-model-policy.yaml\` as the repo-owned source of truth for simple, medium, hard, and arbiter model routing. If it is missing, run \`/gofer:bootstrap-workspace\` before continuing.
2. Use the cheapest capable model first.
   - Claude: Haiku for scouting/extraction; Sonnet for normal implementation, synthesis, validation, and security; Opus for high-risk arbitration or release-critical failures.
   - Codex/OpenAI: GPT mini for simple coding; GPT nano only for locate/classify/summarize/mechanical work; GPT-5.3-Codex or flagship GPT for tool-heavy coding, architecture, and release-critical validation.
   - Gemini: Flash-Lite for cheap large-context scan/summarize; Flash for default research synthesis; Pro for large-context architecture or high-risk arbitration.
   - Copilot: prefer Auto for simple and default work; ask the user before choosing a paid/high-tier picker model for hard security, architecture, or release gates.
3. Keep raw tool output out of the main conversation context. Save stable findings to \`.specify/specs/{feature}/context-bundle.md\`, then work from summaries.
4. Use provider prompt/context caching only for stable, non-secret prefixes: Gofer scaffold, AGENTS/CLAUDE/Copilot instructions, constitution, repo map, stage contracts, and validation rubric.
5. Before continuing after large research, planning, implementation, or validation bursts, checkpoint the durable artifacts and compact/clear/resume context when the host supports it.
6. Escalate model tier only when a cheaper pass is low-confidence, contradictory, security-sensitive, or blocking release quality.

## Business-Friendly Progress Contract
<!-- gofer:business-progress:start -->

Default user-facing updates must be concise, business-level, and easy to scan.
Keep the technical work rigorous in artifacts, tests, logs, and code, but do
not lead with implementation jargon unless the user asks for it.

Use ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English as the target writing standard for
all Gofer-authored chat, documents, commands, summaries, PR notes, error
guidance, and validation artifacts. ASD-STE100 is copyright and a trademark of
ASD; do not bundle the protected ASD dictionary and do not claim ASD
certification.

1. Explain progress as what is being connected, changed, checked, or fixed and
   why it matters to the business outcome.
2. Use the running build map: create or update
   \`.specify/specs/{feature}/build-map.md\` from
   \`.specify/templates/build-map-template.md\` for application delivery, and
   refer to its plain-language areas in progress updates.
3. When there is a problem, translate it into business impact, current status,
   next action, and what input or approval is needed. Keep raw stack traces,
   command logs, IDs, and acronyms out of chat unless asked.
4. If the user asks for technical depth, provide it on request and point to the
   durable artifact that contains the evidence.
5. Prefer a compact update shape:
   - \`Working on\`: the build-map area or stakeholder outcome
   - \`Why it matters\`: user/business impact
   - \`Status\`: done, checking, fixing, blocked, or needs decision
6. Use one action per instruction.
7. Keep instructions to 20 words or fewer where possible.
8. Use active voice unless the actor is unknown or not important.
9. Use simple verb forms: simple present, simple past, simple future,
   infinitive, or imperative.
10. Define acronyms on first use and use approved project terms.
11. Avoid idioms, marketing adjectives, vague praise, and hedging.
12. Use vertical lists for complex information and one topic per paragraph.
13. For errors, state what happened, why it matters, what to do next, and the
    exact safe command when one exists.
14. Do not remove technical validation, security checks, EAI preflights, tests,
   or loop evidence. This contract changes presentation, not engineering
   standards.
15. Before each user-facing reply, check that it leads with the business effect,
    uses concise simple language, and includes only useful technical detail.
16. If any check fails, rewrite the reply before sending it.

## App Preview Runner Contract

For EAI app delivery, every UI preview must use the repo runner when it exists.

1. Use \`./run.sh dev 3001\` on macOS, Linux, and GitHub Codespaces.
2. Use \`run.bat dev 3001\` on Windows.
3. Use a different port only when the feature notes record the reason.
4. Restart only this app. Before stopping a process, verify its exact checkout, process ID, start time and command, then recheck immediately before stopping it. Never stop another app, an unknown process, or every process on a port. If ownership is uncertain, leave it running and ask the user. Inspect older runners before use; do not run one that kills by port alone.
5. Do not use direct \`npm run dev\`, \`next dev\`, or package-manager preview commands when \`run.sh\`, \`run.bat\`, or \`run.ps1\` exists.
6. After every UI-facing change, run:
   - \`node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-ui-preview.mjs --feature-dir {FEATURE_DIR} --command "./run.sh dev 3001" --open auto --screenshot --change "<change summary>"\`

8. If the runner is missing in an EAI app template repo, refresh the template before preview work continues.
9. Check the exact preview page and the current implemented user journey after each change. A running process, open browser, screenshot alone, error page or dry run is not proof that it works. Say ready to view only after those checks pass. Otherwise explain what is unchecked or failing; do not claim readiness. Record fresh browser and test evidence. Local MVP checks cover only implemented behaviour; do not add future auth or deployment gates. Keep showing clearly labelled drafts without adding approval stops.

<!-- gofer:continuation:start -->

1. Preserve the requested scope and mode, including read-only, plan-only, research-only and MVP work. Keep the full applicable pipeline, stage functions, artifacts, reviews and validation; do not expand an MVP into an unapproved release.
2. After a stage's required evidence is complete, read and follow the next internal file in .specify/commands/ in the same conversation. Do not require a numbered command or a host-specific skill dispatcher. Optional helpers remain optional; maintenance and control commands do not start delivery work.
3. After explicit business-specification approval, continue routine planning, tasks, implementation and validation within that approved scope. Record the approval source and scope; missing or ambiguous approval is not approval. A proposal or generated status is not user consent.
4. Preserve any explicit plan/task approval requirement unless it is already satisfied by recorded user approval covering that work. Rejected, revoked, changed or unclear approval requires a pause. Never invent approvedBy, approvedAt or a new approval event when reusing an existing approval.
5. Pause for material scope, security, cost, deployment, destructive or protected files/boundary changes and any outstanding user gate. Business approval does not authorize publishing, spending, external changes or bypassing host permissions. Complete safe authorized work without bypassing the blocked gate.
6. A tool proposal is not execution. If host consent is required, wait for it. After the tool result or approved proposal returns, inspect the result and resume the next authorized action within approved scope; do not end with only a plan or a proposed tool call. A denied tool or unavailable capability must not be bypassed through another host or CLI.
7. Use the current agent's available native tools. Optional Gofer/MCP tools are conveniences, not prerequisites. If the current agent lacks a required capability, report that limitation and the safe next action; do not pretend a handoff button transfers control automatically.
8. Stop after research only when research-only work was requested, the user paused, or a real gate blocks progress. Otherwise continue to specification. At validation, report completion only when the requested scope's required evidence passes; failures remain unfinished work.
9. Respect budget, context and retry limits from the existing loop contract. Repair safe within-scope failures only within those limits. Preserve a checkpoint before an orderly context stop; resume by reading its recorded stage and rechecking scope, approvals and evidence. Never claim an abrupt host termination was handled.
10. Report concise Progress during work. At every controlled stop, report Progress, Stop reason and Next action, including the exact missing input or approval and unfinished work. Reasons are requested scope complete, user pause, approval required, material change, missing capability/access, validation blocked, or budget/context/retry limit. Stage completion alone is not pipeline completion.

**Blocker Mediation**

- Before repeating a failed action or asking for missing input, read .specify/references/blocker-mediation.md and inspect the private blocker register with gofer-blocker-control.mjs. Reuse the same state directory and goal, subject and condition keys across stages, restarts and surfaces. Different wording, models or tools do not create a new blocker.
- Classify the cause first. Missing user decisions, access, external dependencies and unavailable capabilities require a recorded wait. Reserve an ask event before asking; ask once, explain the business impact and required change, then stop affected work. An unanswered question is not new evidence. Do not poll or rephrase it to keep running.
- Technical ask events require a fresh verification file under .specify/references/priority-outcome-protection.md: actual diagnosis, self-cause check and why no authorized repair is available. Business choices need no failed command. For feature tasks, use gofer-priority-check.mjs and the saved direction before switching work; this does not start delivery during maintenance or conversation.
- For AI-solvable or unknown causes, reserve each attempt before execution. Allow one investigation and one different recovery within existing tighter budgets. Record its result even when interrupted or unsuccessful. An unfinished reservation must not launch again. Do not reset the register, change keys or switch surfaces to obtain more attempts.
- Resume only after a real user answer or changed external evidence has been recorded and checked. The helper allows one evidence-backed resumption; exhausted limits need human review. Never invent approval or evidence. Successful model output and a running server do not resolve a blocker without the relevant check.
- Save the blocker, unfinished tasks and next action before stopping. Continue only approved tasks that do not depend on it. Keep the original goal; update specs, plans, tasks and validation for accepted direction changes, and reopen stale checks. Do not quietly drop requirements to make progress.
- Use node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-blocker-control.mjs --state-dir <private-state-directory> --event <private-event.json> before controlled actions; inspect with --state-dir alone, or add --task T001 for an independent task. A denied action, invalid record or missing helper means stop and explain the limitation, not bypass it. Use the installed plugin script path if no repo scaffold exists. Conversation-only work uses a private session state directory and does not require app setup or feature files.
- Strict loop validation checks every recorded feature blocker. Shared instructions guide native chats; this helper cannot intercept calls that a host sends directly. Do not claim native enforcement from package tests alone.`;

ASD-STE100 is copyright and a trademark of ASD; do not bundle the protected ASD dictionary and do not claim ASD certification.\n\nApply these rules before any user-facing output:\n\n1. Use short sentences. Keep instructions to 20 words or fewer where possible.\n2. Use one action per instruction.\n3. Use active voice. Use passive voice only when the actor is unknown or not important.\n4. Use simple present, simple past, simple future, infinitive, or imperative verb forms.\n5. Use approved project terms and necessary technical nouns only. Define acronyms on first use.\n6. Use direct words. Avoid idioms, marketing adjectives, vague praise, and hedging.\n7. Use vertical lists for complex information.\n8. Put one topic in each paragraph.\n9. For errors, write: what happened, why it matters, what to do next, and the exact safe command when one exists.\n10. Keep raw logs, stack traces, IDs, and secrets out of chat unless the user asks for technical detail.\n\n## Light Plugin And Repo Scripts\n\nThe light plugin installs durable Gofer knowledge and app integration metadata. The repository remains the source of truth for executable scripts, commands, templates, specs, and memory. After bootstrap, agents should prefer repo-local scripts over bundled fallback copies because the repo can be updated by \`eai gofer refresh\` or the VS Code extension.\n\n## App vs Non-App Routing\n\n- Classify each request before EAI readiness as EAI app delivery, non-application work, or ambiguous.\n- If the request is EAI app delivery or ambiguous, continue directly into the EAI app delivery path and run EAI readiness.\n- If the request is clearly non-app work, confirm once: **"This looks like non-app work, so I will skip EAI tenant/app setup and continue the Gofer research/docs path. Is that right?"**\n- If the user confirms non-app, do not run \`eai whoami\`, tenant selection, \`eai init\`, or first-run setup. Record the decision and continue the appropriate non-app path.\n\n## First EAI Platform App\n\nIf the user is starting a first EAI Platform app, use this public entrypoint and then follow the first-run/setup contract in \`.specify/commands/gofer_eai_first_run.md\` when it is present.

This file documents the public Gofer command surface and internal pipeline contracts.

Generated: ${timestamp}

## Public Entrypoints

- \`eai\` - Start or continue Gofer from one user-facing command.

Do not expose numbered or helper stage commands in user-facing pickers. They remain available as internal contracts under \`.specify/commands/\`.

${buildUserFacingResponseGateSection()}

${buildAlwaysEaiSection()}

${buildVerifiedEaiCliCommandContract()}

## EAI CLI Discovery And Recovery

- Classify work before EAI readiness: app delivery continues directly; clear non-app work asks once before skipping EAI tenant/app setup.
- Run \`eai update --check\` before first EAI platform work when the CLI may be stale.
- Run \`eai --describe\` before assuming command syntax.
- If advertised, run \`eai agent guide --format json\` before planning or fixing EAI workflows.
- After any \`eai\` error, run \`eai errors explain <code-or-reason> --format json\` before guessing remediation.
- If \`eai errors explain\` is unavailable, match \`.specify/references/platform/eai-error-catalog.yaml\`, run read-only diagnostics before mutating fixes, and stop at the retry or escalation condition.
- For \`eai user invite\` 5xx or \`EXTERNAL_SERVICE_ERROR\`, check existing members with \`eai user list --tenant <tenant-id> --search <email> --format json\`; use \`eai user role set --tenant <tenant-id> --member-id <member-id> --role tenant-admin --format json\` only after verification and user approval, then tell the app user to sign out and sign back in.
- For \`MISSING_TENANT\`, \`app_token_tenant_context_required\`, or "Tenant context required for app tokens" on platform user lookup or membership prerequisites, run \`eai errors explain app_token_tenant_context_required --format json\`, confirm tenant context, and retry \`/v4/platform/tenants/<tenant-id>/...\` routes before changing tenant members, Entra, role definitions, databases, or cloud portals.
- Use \`eai publicapi\` only for authorized PublicAPI \`/v4/...\` routes.
