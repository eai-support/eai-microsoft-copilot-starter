# Gofer Command: 8_gofer_branding

Use this skill when the user asks for `8_gofer_branding`, `#8_gofer_branding`, or `8-gofer-branding`.

## Workspace Preflight

Before doing stage/helper work:

1. Resolve the repository root.
2. Check the core Gofer sentinels:
   - `.specify/.gofer-version`
   - `.specify/commands#0_gofer_start.md`
   - `.specify/templates/spec-template.md`
   - `.specify/templates/loop-contract-template.json`
   - `.specify/templates/working-backwards-prfaq-template.md`
   - `.specify/templates/business-owner-summary-template.md`
   - `.specify/templates/cto-architecture-summary-template.md`
   - `.specify/templates/ciso-security-summary-template.md`
   - `.specify/templates/stakeholder-review-index-template.md`
   - `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh`
   - `.specify/scripts/node/parse-stage-command.mjs`
   - `.specify/scripts/node/gofer-loop-audit.mjs`
   - `.specify/scripts/hooks/post-tool-use.mjs`
   - `.specify/scripts/powershell/install-optional-tools.ps1`
   - `.specify/templates/gofer-model-policy.yaml`
   - `.specify/memory/gofer-model-policy.yaml`
   - `.specify/specs/`
   - `.specify/memory/`
3. Check host-specific repo-owned files when relevant:
   - Claude: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`
   - Codex: `AGENTS.md`
   - Copilot: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
   - VS Code extension mirrors Claude/Copilot/Gemini resources itself and should still keep the core scaffold healthy
4. If the repo already has the workspace checker script, prefer running:
   - `node .specify/scripts/node/gofer-workspace-check.mjs --host claude --json`
5. If the workspace is missing or stale, ask exactly:
   - **"This repo is missing or stale for Gofer. Initialize/update it now?"**
6. If the user says yes, run the Gofer workspace bootstrap helper and then resume this command from the top.
7. If the user says no, stop and explain that Gofer stage/helper work depends on the repo-owned scaffold.

# Gofer Branding

## EAI Platform Session Preflight

Before any Gofer stage/helper command does pipeline work:

1. Treat durable delivery as EAI Platform delivery by default, with Azure second
   and every other stack only by explicit exception.
2. Run `eai whoami` and confirm the EAI CLI is installed, the user is logged in,
   and an active tenant is visible.
3. If `eai` is missing, `eai whoami` fails, the token is expired, or no active
   tenant is available, stop and run `/gofer:eai-first-run` or ask the user to
   approve login/setup before continuing.
4. For EAI app delivery, do not continue into research, specification, planning,
   tasks, implementation, or validation until
   `.specify/specs/{feature}/eai-preflight.md` records login, tenant, template,
   app-readiness, and next-action evidence.
5. Do not write tokens, secrets, private tenant IDs, or local `.env` values into
   Gofer artifacts; record only product-safe readiness status and evidence.

## Token And Cost Policy
<!-- gofer:token-cost-policy:start -->

Before spawning agents, calling tools, or loading large files:

1. Treat `.specify/memory/gofer-model-policy.yaml` as the repo-owned source of truth for simple, medium, hard, and arbiter model routing. If it is missing, run `/gofer:bootstrap-workspace` before continuing.
2. Use the cheapest capable model first.
   - Claude: Haiku for scouting/extraction; Sonnet for normal implementation, synthesis, validation, and security; Opus for high-risk arbitration or release-critical failures.
   - Codex/OpenAI: GPT mini for simple coding; GPT nano only for locate/classify/summarize/mechanical work; GPT-5.3-Codex or flagship GPT for tool-heavy coding, architecture, and release-critical validation.
   - Gemini: Flash-Lite for cheap large-context scan/summarize; Flash for default research synthesis; Pro for large-context architecture or high-risk arbitration.
   - Copilot: prefer Auto for simple and default work; ask the user before choosing a paid/high-tier picker model for hard security, architecture, or release gates.
3. Keep raw tool output out of the main conversation context. Save stable findings to `.specify/specs/{feature}/context-bundle.md`, then work from summaries.
4. Use provider prompt/context caching only for stable, non-secret prefixes: Gofer scaffold, AGENTS/CLAUDE/Copilot instructions, constitution, repo map, stage contracts, and validation rubric.
5. Before continuing after large research, planning, implementation, or validation bursts, checkpoint the durable artifacts and compact/clear/resume context when the host supports it.
6. Escalate model tier only when a cheaper pass is low-confidence, contradictory, security-sensitive, or blocking release quality.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

---

## Purpose

Use this helper when a company, enterprise customer, consulting firm, or
delivery team wants Gofer outputs to look and read like their standard branded
materials.

This command updates repo-owned branding guidance and templates. It does not
change feature scope, acceptance criteria, architecture decisions, or validation
evidence.

---

## Safety Rules

1. Do not copy private brand guides, logos, screenshots, client names, tenant
   IDs, or internal marks into a public Gofer bundle.
2. In the public `eai-gofer` repo, ship only neutral placeholders and reusable
   template tokens.
3. In an initialized application repo, write company-specific values only to
   repo-local files the user approves.
4. If a logo or brand guide path is missing, mark it `pending` instead of
   inventing one.
5. If the user asks for a client or partner logo, ask for the approved asset
   path and usage permission before adding it.

---

## Brand Profile Contract

Create or update:

```text
.specify/memory/brand-profile.json
```

If the file is missing, start from:

```text
.specify/templates/brand/brand-profile-template.json
```

The profile MUST capture:

```json
{
  "organizationName": "",
  "documentAudience": "executive|technical|risk|delivery|mixed",
  "brandMode": "company|client|consulting-firm|co-branded|neutral",
  "logo": {
    "primaryPath": "",
    "secondaryPath": "",
    "usage": "header|cover|footer|none",
    "status": "approved|pending|not-applicable"
  },
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#000000",
    "secondary": "#ffffff",
    "accent": "#0f766e",
    "background": "#ffffff",
    "text": "#111827"
  },
  "typography": {
    "headingFont": "",
    "bodyFont": "",
    "monoFont": "",
    "baseSize": "11pt",
    "h1Size": "28pt",
    "h2Size": "18pt",
    "lineHeight": "1.35"
  },
  "layout": {
    "pageSize": "A4|Letter|16:9",
    "margins": "standard|compact|spacious",
    "headerText": "",
    "footerText": "",
    "confidentialityLabel": ""
  },
  "visualStyle": {
    "diagramTheme": "neutral|executive|technical|minimal",
    "mermaidTheme": "base|neutral|forest|dark",
    "marpThemePath": ".specify/templates/brand/marp-theme-template.css"
  },
  "review": {
    "owner": "",
    "approvedBy": "",
    "approvedAt": "",
    "sourceEvidence": []
  }
}
```

## Inputs To Discover

Search first, then ask only for missing decisions that block useful output:

- Existing brand files: `brand.json`, `brand.yaml`, `brand.md`, `brand-guide.*`,
  `style-guide.*`, `assets/brand/`, `docs/brand/`, `public/logo.*`.
- Company name, consulting firm name, client name, and co-branding preference.
- Logo paths and which logo is approved for cover, header, and footer usage.
- Primary, secondary, accent, background, and text colors.
- Heading, body, monospace fonts, and fallback fonts.
- Header/footer text, confidentiality label, copyright, and prepared-by line.
- Preferred artifact formats: Markdown, PDF, Marp deck, HTML, or VS Code
  preview.
- Audience defaults for Business Owner, CTO/Architecture, CISO/Risk, and
  Delivery documents.

If the user gives a plain-language request such as "make it look like a Big 4
consulting deck", create a tasteful neutral consulting-firm profile and clearly
state that no third-party brand identity is being copied.

---

## Template Targets

Apply the brand profile to template guidance for:

- `.specify/templates/stakeholder-comms-template.md`
- `.specify/templates/working-backwards-prfaq-template.md`
- `.specify/templates/business-owner-summary-template.md`
- `.specify/templates/cto-architecture-summary-template.md`
- `.specify/templates/ciso-security-summary-template.md`
- `.specify/templates/stakeholder-review-index-template.md`
- `.specify/templates/spec-template.md`
- `.specify/templates/plan-template.md`
- `.specify/templates/research-template.md`
- `.specify/templates/brand/marp-theme-template.css`

For feature-local documents, apply the profile to existing artifacts under:

```text
.specify/specs/{feature}/
```

Use headings, frontmatter, document preambles, Mermaid theme hints, Marp theme
references, footer/confidentiality text, and logo placeholders. Do not rewrite
approved technical content just to change tone.

---

## Execution Steps

### 1. Resolve Scope

Determine whether the user wants:

- **Global repo branding**: update `.specify/memory/brand-profile.json` and
  reusable templates.
- **Feature branding**: update one feature pack in `.specify/specs/{feature}/`.
- **Preview only**: show proposed changes without writing files.

If unclear, default to global repo branding plus no feature-content rewrite.

### 2. Build Or Update Brand Profile

1. Read existing `.specify/memory/brand-profile.json` if present.
2. Read `.specify/templates/brand/brand-profile-template.json`.
3. Merge discovered values with user-provided values.
4. Preserve existing approved values unless the user explicitly changes them.
5. Write `.specify/memory/brand-profile.json` only after reporting what will
   change.

### 3. Apply Template Guidance

Update templates so future generated documents know how to use the brand
profile:

- Add `brand-profile.json` as a source input where stakeholder-facing outputs
  are generated.
- Add a short `Branding And Presentation` section where missing.
- Reference the Marp theme for deck-like summaries.
- Keep Mermaid and markdown-table fallbacks readable in monochrome print.
- Keep every document's executive summary first.

### 4. Validate

Run these checks where applicable:

```bash
node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('.specify/memory/brand-profile.json','utf8'))"
rg -n "api[_-]?key|secret|token|tenant|password" .specify/memory/brand-profile.json .specify/templates/brand
```

If Marp is available and a deck was changed:

```bash
npx marp --version
npx marp path/to/deck.md --preview=false --allow-local-files
```

Validation fails if:

- `brand-profile.json` is invalid JSON.
- Private credentials or tenant-specific secrets appear in the brand profile.
- A logo path is referenced as approved but does not exist.
- A generated stakeholder document lacks an executive summary.
- A diagram/deck becomes unreadable without the brand assets.

### 5. Report

End with:

```text
BRANDING UPDATED
Scope: global|feature|preview
Brand profile: .specify/memory/brand-profile.json
Templates touched: [list]
Pending approvals: [logos/fonts/colors/confidentiality text]
Validation: PASS|FAIL
Next suggested command: /7a_stakeholder_comms or #6_gofer_validate
```

---

## Decline Behavior

If the user does not want to provide brand details, keep the neutral Gofer brand
tokens and write only the generic profile. Do not block the core Gofer pipeline
because branding is incomplete.
